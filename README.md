This is a multi-line Markdown comment.
Note the two common methods for inserting images:
  Use HTML: <img src='images/streamlit_QR_screenshot.jpg' alt='dashboard' height=200/>
  Use Markdown: ![dashboard](images/streamlit_QR_screenshot.jpg)

I like the <img> method since it lets you easily control the height and other attributes.
